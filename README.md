# How to play with me?

I will need python 3.9+ to run and after installed, you can use these commands to install and launch me.

```
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
python start.py
```

# What do you have to be careful about

Even if I can handle most of terminal size. I will not appreciate running on a very small size.
Run me in full size and I will be fine.

Also note that I usually get sick if you try to resize your terminal windows during the execution.

Talking about terminal. I used to run well on Windows Shell or PowerShell.
About linux or macOs, I should be able to run but I haven't done enought try to confirm that.
